  "Because of the omnipresence of control systems in our universe (and the nonexistent of anything beyond causality), software with the ability to create, network, and implement intelligent automata (and intelligent automata networks) should be abstract enough to be applied - with great potency - to a myriad of various problems in a gargantuan multitude of industries, at an unprecedented scale and pace. Imagine an interconnected network of communicating intelligent autonomous control systems managing real-world systems - and integrating data and APIs from various sources (including input from other IANs) - to automate and dynamically optimize these systems for hyper performance of custom metrics. This is the mechanism, in which I envision AU7OMA7A to provide an avenue for rapid technological hyper-acceleration, via proliferation ignition of digital, intelligent, autonomous, and cybernetic hive mind technologies. Whatever I do, I seek excellence and am in eternal competition with myself. I seek understanding and leverage; and will bring an analytical eye, and a passion for learning and providing insight to the team.";
